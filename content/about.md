Over the course of my career I have performed many roles and accomplished a few diverse things over time.

* 2015-2021:  **Cloud Migrations** - Migrated applications to the cloud at scale and created a methodology for cloud migrations at scale.  Have advised and delivered on many cloud migration projects, including Migrations for Honeywell, Cargill, General Electric.
* 2021: (what I did during the pandemic). Built a ground up new way of thinking about cloud management while contributed to the [AWS Well Architected Management and Governance Lens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/management-and-governance-lens/management-and-governance-lens.html?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card)
* 2020: Hired, Developed and Built a team of 30 organized into multidiscipline squads to accelerate cloud migrations to AWS Managed Services.
* 2014:  Ran the DevOps Infrastructure for Roadtrippers.com
* 2011-2012:  Built a class 3 data center for Seapine.com.
* 2003:  Learned to love vi and unix while running the ERP systems for Evenflo.
* 1997:  Got a "paper" MCSE with very little real IT experience and somehow convinced Digineer to try me out as a junior sysadmin.
