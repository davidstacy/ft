I've been trying to figure out how to make it easier to manage cloud environments for about five years now.  maybe longer.  There are two schools of thought.  One - anything at scale is hard, scale is hard, cloud at scale is hard too.  theres no shortcuts.  I hate this school, its too pessimistic.  But it feels right, sadly.

The other school of thought is that we just really havent figured it out yet, maybe theres a tool, technique or method that is so radically simple and easy that it changes whole industries yet.  Is this Kubernetes?  I think its what Kubernetes wants to be but its not quite there yet.  Kubernetes has issues.  We'll get to those in a future post.  Maybe.  Hopefully.

This site is setup to explore which of these schools is correct, hopefully #2, and maybe we'll figure out what it would take to make the second school "real". and maybe then, once we know what we are looking for in a cloud management system.  Stay tuned!
