There are two schools of thought. One - anything at scale is hard, scale is hard, cloud at scale is hard too. theres no shortcuts. I hate this school, its too pessimistic. But it feels right, sadly.
The other school of thought is that we just really havent figured it out yet, maybe theres a tool, technique or method that is so radically simple and easy that it changes whole industries yet.</description></item></channel></rss>
